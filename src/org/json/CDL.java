/**
 * This provides static methods to convert comma delimited text into a
 * JSONArray, and to covert a JSONArray into comma delimited text. Comma
 * delimited text is a very popular format for data interchange. It is
 * understood by most database, spreadsheet, and organizer programs.
 * <p>
 * Each row of text represents a row in a table or a data record. Each row
 * ends with a NEWLINE character. Each row contains one or more values.
 * Values are separated by commas. A value can contain any character except
 * for comma, unless is is wrapped in single quotes or double quotes.
 * <p>
 * The first row usually contains the names of the columns.
 * <p>
 * A comma delimited list can be converted into a JSONArray of JSONObjects.
 * The names for the elements in the JSONObjects can be taken from the names
 * in the first row.
